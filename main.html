	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run in relation to the size of the input data. An efficient algorithm is one that exhibits low time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to perform a task, typically expressed as O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input data. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial when working with limited memory resources, and optimizing it is essential in designing efficient algorithms.</p>
